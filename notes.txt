NAND:
>(A,B) = %(A,%(B,B))
=(A,B) = %(%(%(A,A),%(B,B)),%(A,B))
|(A,B) = %(%(A,A),%(B,B))
&(A,B) = %(%(A,B),%(A,B))
~(A) = %(A,A)

Algorithm for nandify:
look at the current node, and based on it, create a NAND base node for the new tree
in place of values of A and B run the same method again(so recursion) to get the left and right nandified subtrees
